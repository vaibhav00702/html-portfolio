<h1>The Best Movies According to Vaibhav</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>A longtime bad guy leaves the life of crime in pursuit of peace and quiet,<br/>
    but naturally gets dragged back to his old haunts and habits to settle a final score. <br>
     But “John Wick” breathes exhilarating life into this tired premise,<br>
      thanks to some dazzling action choreography.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie.</p>
<h3>into The Wild</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>
